Ruby gem to create meme images (images with text added at the top and bottom).

Also includes Sinatra app that exposes API over HTTP which is currently
running "http://memecaptain.com/":http://memecaptain.com/

Works with animated gifs.

<code>
require 'meme_captain'

require 'open-uri'

open('http://image_from_web_or_local_file.jpg', 'rb') do |f|
  i = MemeCaptain.meme(f, 'test', '1 2 3')
  i.display
  i.write('out.jpg')
end
</code>
